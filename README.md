# nutsorter
Matching nuts and bolts with my own algorithm.

Rules:
1) You have a set of different sized matching nuts and bolts that are scrambled in random order into two piles, one pile for nuts, one pile for bolts.
2) You can only compare a nut with a bolt (or vice versa) to check if they fit together, one is bigger than the other, or one is smaller than the other.
3) No nut to nut or bolt to bolt comparison allowed.
4) Try to find the matching nuts and bolts with an optimal algorithm.
